### Write a Python function that will receive a list as an argument.
    1- The function will receive a list of at least 5 numbers as a single argument when the function is called.
    2. The function will ask the user to input a number and will find and return the index of that number in the list.
    3. If the number is not an element of the list, the function returns the string "unknown" and 
        asks the user to try again. 
        There can be a total of 3 possible failed trials, 
        after which the program will return a message to the user and exit. 
        Choose your own exit message.

### Write a Python function that will do the following:

    1. Ask the user to input an integer that will be appended to a list that was originally empty. 
        This will be done 5 times, meaning that when the input is complete, 
        the list will have five elements (all integers).
    2. Determine whether each element is an even number or an odd number
    3. Return a list of five string elements "odd" and "even" that map the indexes of the elements of the input list, 
        according to whether these elements are even or odd numbers. 
    
    For example: if the input sequence is 10, 7, 9, 51,  and 100, 
    the function will return the list ["even", "odd", "odd", "odd", "even"].

### Write a Python program that will 
    ask the user to input a word, will return the first letter of the input word, 
    and ask the user to put another word, and so on, in the form of a loop. 
    If the user chooses to stop, he or she should input the 
    integer "0" for the loop to stop.

### White a Python function that 
    will ask the user for an integer X bigger 
    than 20 and return a list "ls" of 10 distinct random integers 
    taken between the interval 0, to X. 
    None of the 10 elements of "ls" should be repeated.

### Write a FUNCTION that 
    asks the user to input a string. Unless the user inputs "END" or "end", or "End", or any case of the word "END", 
    a loop will execute wherein the user is asked to input a string. Each time the loop runs and the user input a string, the function does the following:
    1- Print the number of letters in the string that the user inputs;
    2- Print the number of digits in the string that the user inputs.

    When the user enters "END" or "end" the loop stops and the 
    function prints the aggregate numbers of letters and digits that the user 
    has entered from the beginning.
    
    Example:
    1st loop: a8K6H     => 3 letters and 2 numbers
    2nd loop: THGF*T425    => 5 letters and 3 numbers
    Aggragates: 8 letters and 5 numbers
